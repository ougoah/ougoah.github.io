<hr style="height:1pt;"/>

I'm an Assistant Professor at the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center (YMSC) at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

Prior to this, I was a postdoc at Texas A&M University working with [Guoliang Yu](https://www.math.tamu.edu/directory/formalpg.php?user=guoliangyu). I received my Ph.D. in December 2018 from the University of Adelaide under the direction of [Mathai Varghese](http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/mathai.varghese/) and [Hang Wang](https://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~wanghang/intro_c.html?language=2&id=204).

I am interested in connections between geometry, topology, analysis, and group theory.
