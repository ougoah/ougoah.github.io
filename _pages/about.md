<hr style="height:1pt;"/>

I'm a tenure-track Assistant Professor at the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center (YMSC) at Tsinghua University in Beijing.

Here you can find a list of my written work and information about my teaching and organisational activities, past and present.

Before coming to Tsinghua, I was a postdoc at Texas A&M University working with [Guoliang Yu](https://www.math.tamu.edu/~guoliangyu/). I received my Ph.D. in December 2018 from the University of Adelaide under the direction of [Mathai Varghese](http://www.maths.adelaide.edu.au/mathai.varghese/) and [Hang Wang](https://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~wanghang/intro_c.html?language=2&id=204).

My research can be understood as part of a broader attempt to discern connections between geometry, group theory, and topology using tools from functional analysis and algebra, such as index theory and K-theory.
