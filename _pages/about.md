Hi, I'm Hao Guo.
==

**Hi, I'm Hao Guo.**

I'm currently an Assistant Professor at the Yau Mathematical Sciences Center at Tsinghua University.

Prior to this, I was a Visiting Assistant Professor at Texas A&M University. I received my Ph.D. in December 2018 from the University of Adelaide under the supervision of Mathai Varghese and Hang Wang.

I am interested in understanding connections between geometry, group theory, and topology using ideas from functional analysis and algebra. So far my research has mostly centred around index theory, which lies at the intersection of these areas.

Here is a more detailed [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LqtzozQGQCMIsoV0Y3dlHbgq3F6zohd2/view?usp=sharing) (updated April 2022).
